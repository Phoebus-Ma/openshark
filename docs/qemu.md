# Introduction

QEMU (Quick Emulator) is a free and open-source emulator. It emulates the 
machine's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of 
different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a 
variety of guest operating systems. It can interoperate with Kernel-based 
Virtual Machine (KVM) to run virtual machines at near-native speed. QEMU can 
also do emulation for user-level processes, allowing applications compiled for 
one architecture to run on another.
